    <h4> Literacy Volunteers of Berkshire County</h4>
    <p> is a community non-profit dedicated to helping adults gain the literacy
    skills they need to communicate effectively, empowering them to reach their
    goals. Our trained volunteers provide confidential, free, one-on-one tutoring
    to adult learners in basic reading and writing, and in conversational English
    for speakers of other languages (ESOL). Tutors meet year-round with their
    students, and lessons are individualized so adults can study at their own
    pace, using materials of importance  or     of interest to them.
